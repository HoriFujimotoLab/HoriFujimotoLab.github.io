For further developmentof future electric motorsport, this study pursues ultimate maneuverability of an independent-four-wheel-drive electricvehicle (EV). The group of the authors has developed a driving force controller (DFC) with slip ratio control, whichcan be used for effective traction control of tire. However, all the experimental verification related to the DFC wereonly conducted using low-power EV on slippery road. The purpose of this paper is to confirm the effectiveness of theDFC using high-power racing EV on dry road. All-out acceleration without control, with manual pedal control by aprofessional driver, and with the slip ratio control are compared. The experimental results suggest that the DFC canaccelerate the EV as efficient as professional driver, promising enough to adopt it for real high-power racing EVs.","tags":["IEEJ","SAMCON","EV"],"title":"Experimental Verification of Driving Force Controller Using High-Power Racing Electric Vehicle","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Masahiro Mae","Wataru Ohnishi","Hiroshi Fujimoto","Yoichi Hori"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1551398400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551398400,"objectID":"3b1b1e697fa5328ab0fd2e19584a0ef2","permalink":"https://publication.hflab.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/publication/2019/190301_ieej_mae/","publishdate":"2019-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019/190301_ieej_mae/","section":"publication","summary":"High-precision stages are widely used for manufacturing semiconductors and flat panels. These high-precision stages have become multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems with six-degrees-of-freedom (DOF); hence, the coupling between the translation and pitching motion deteriorates the control performance. This study proposes the multirate feedforward control for MIMO systems and applies it to these high-precision stages. The multirate feedforward control designs the stable inversion for the unstable discretization zero problem. In addition, the design of the MIMO multirate feedforward controllers has a degree of freedom to design the B matrix according to the selection of the generalized controllability indices. In conventional control methods such as precompensated decoupling controllers, it is theoretically impossible to achieve perfect tracking because unstable discretization zeros are generated. In this study, the proposed method is applied to the translation and pitching motion of a high-precision stage, and it achieves perfect tracking in the simulation. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified experimentally.","tags":["IEEJ","JIA","NanoScaleServo"],"title":"Perfect Tracking Control Considering Generalized Controllability Indices and Application for High-Precision Stage in Translation and Pitching","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yoshi Ri","Hiroshi Fujimoto"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"ec4d7a62c0f386990159d0cbb104cc60","permalink":"https://publication.hflab.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/publication/2019/ieej_d_ri_2019/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019/ieej_d_ri_2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Image registration plays a very important role in a camera-based remote sensing system. This paper discusses a 2D fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based method, which is well known for its easy implementation, accuracy, and robustness. The problem with the FFT-based method is that its robustness and accuracy highly depend on some preprocessing such as the design of a bandpass filter and subpixel estimation. This paper provided solutions for its algorithm design and tuning issues. Finally, the evaluation based on the image dataset and the actual images demonstrated its effectiveness.","tags":["IEEJ","電気学会論文誌D","ImageProcessing"],"title":"FFTに基づくロバストな画像のレジストレーション手法の設計","type":"publication"}]
